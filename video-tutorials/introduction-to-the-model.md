## Introduction to the Model

In this video will learn how to work with JSON data indirectly through a Falcor Model. The Falcor Model allows you to work with data using the same familiar JavaScript path syntax. However the Model uses a push API, sending the data to a callback rather than returning it immediately. Using a push API means that you can move your data anywhere in the network later on, without changing the data retrieval code in your client.
