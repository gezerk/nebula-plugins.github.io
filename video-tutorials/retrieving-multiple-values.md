## Retrieving Multiple Values

In addition to being able to retrieve a path from a Falcor Model, you can also retrieve multiple Path Sets. Path Sets are paths that contain ranges or multiple string keys inside of indexers. In addition to being able to retrieve a Path Set, you can also retrieve as many paths as you like in a single method call.
