## Why Falcor?

Every user of a web application wants to believe that all of the data in the cloud is sitting right on their device. Netflix's data platform "JSON Graph" creates this illusion for the web developer.

One Model, Available Everywhere. Using an innovative combination of reactive programming techniques and RESTful principles, JSON Graph allows web developers to create a virtual server JSON model for their web application and transparently access it from any cloud-connected device.

The Data is the API. Using JSON Graph, Netflix developers retrieve data from the virtual server model the same way they would from an in-memory JSON object. Efficient client/server interactions are ensured by batching concurrent idempotent requests, transparently optimizing requests into point queries, and caching recently-used data.
