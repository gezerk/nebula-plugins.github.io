{"name":"Welcome to Nebula","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Nebula\r\nThe nebula-plugins organization was setup to facilitate the generation, governance, and releasing of Gradle plugins. It is done by providing a space to host plugins, in SCM, CI, and a Repository. A single GitHub organization is used, for which anyone or any plugin can be added. Cloudbees jobs are created for every plugin to provide a standard set of jobs. Releases are posted to bintray, proxied to JCenter and synced to Maven Central. While not all steps are automated (yet), the goal to a self-service fast controlled flow plugins out to entire Gradle community.\r\n\r\nnebula-plugins was founded by Justin Ryan (@quidryan) as an effort at Netflix to share it's internal build infrastructure.\r\n\r\n## SCM\r\n\r\nThe GitHub organization nebula-plugins (https://github.com/nebula-plugins/) is just that, an organization. Any willing contributor can be added to the organization. That allows a level of collaboration between interested parties that isn't available when a plugin is locked up in an user's account.\r\n\r\n## Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nUsing Cloudbees, there's a hosted Jenkins instance (via Netflix) to host build jobs (https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/nebula-plugins/). The Job DSL plugin is used to ensure the jobs are standardize, and updated when improvements are made (https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/nebula-plugins/job/SEED-nebula-plugins/). The core jobs are ones to build the HEAD, check pull requests, and release the plugin.\r\n\r\n## Repositories\r\n\r\nUpon release, a plugin is uploaded to the nebula-plugins organization in bintray (https://bintray.com/nebula/gradle-plugins). If configured correctly, those uploads are linked to JCenter, meaning they're instantly available to any Gradle user using the _jcenter()_ repository. They are then synced to Maven Central under the com.netflix.nebula group name.\r\n\r\n## To Get Started\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\n\r\nJoin the Google Group nebula-plugins to questions, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nebula-plugins.","google":"UA-45094619-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
